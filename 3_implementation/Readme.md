## Implementation 
## ## Algorithm of Calculator Program:-

Step 1: Declare local variables n1, n2, ans, choice. For example, where n1 and n2 take two numeric values, ans will store results and choice variable define the operator symbols.

Step 2: Print the Choice (Addition, Subtraction, multiplication, division, factorial , square , squareroot , power , modulus , trigno etc.

Step 3: Enter the Choice

Step 4: Takes two numbers, n1 and n2

Step 5: Switch case jump to an operator selected by the user

Step 6: Store result into res variable.

Step 7: Display the operation result

Step 8: Exit from the program.
