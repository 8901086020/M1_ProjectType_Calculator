# Calculator  

## Introduction:-   
Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic four operations in mathematics ,they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division but in this Project
which I'm Implementing ,also included three additional operations such as Factorial, Power ,modulas .However, the input has to be in the form "number1 operator1 number2
"(i.e 2+4).    

The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the
order of precedence logic.    

## Research:-

The switch-case statement is used to write a simple calculator program in C language. The remainder operator % is normally used with data values. To print the remainder
operator %% is used in the first printf() function. The variable ch store the operator, similarly the variables num1, and num2 stores the two numbers. The switch has condition “ch” so the entered operator is matched with which case label those case label statements are executed, and display result to the screen. If the entered operator is not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message “Error! Invalid Operator.” to the screen.  



## Swot Analysis

 
**STRENGTHS**   
  
  
The ultimate strength Calculators is its innovative,user-friendly and long
lasting etc..    

**WEAKNESSES**  

do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction
multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.    

**OPPORTUNITIES**    


The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth
market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than
other    

**THREATS**  

The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant
threat in the upcoming dynamic world.

# 4W's and 1'H :-

- # What
  calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.
- # Where

It has to be used easily by the users and complete work on time.

- # When

It has to be deployed 25th of November 2021.

- # Why

I am Developing this basic calculator because so that the user can easily do thier work with some new functuion. 

- # How

I am using C programming language for Developing this simple basic calculator.

## Implementation 
## ## Algorithm of Calculator Program:-

Step 1: Declare local variables n1, n2, ans, choice. For example, where n1 and n2 take two numeric values, ans will store results and choice variable define the operator symbols.

Step 2: Print the Choice (Addition, Subtraction, multiplication, division, factorial , square , squareroot , power , modulus , trigno etc.

Step 3: Enter the Choice

Step 4: Takes two numbers, n1 and n2

Step 5: Switch case jump to an operator selected by the user

Step 6: Store result into res variable.

Step 7: Display the operation result

Step 8: Exit from the program.
